# dotfiles
My configuration files for Debian/Ubuntu-based distros (and possibly OS X).

## .init.vim / .vimrc
Neo(Vim) configuration for JavaScript, Ruby and Python development. Using the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager for fast parallel installation, and [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) for easy switching between Vim splits and tmux panes.

## .zshrc
Zsh configuration with improved autocompletion, [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), and history lookup.

## .tmux.conf
tmux configuration with the other half of the [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) integration.

## .profile
Set-up for local environment variables including the [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape) utility to use the Caps Lock key as an Esc when tapped, and as a Ctrl when held down. Recommended for Emacs users as well.
